# Mini Compiler

A simple mini compiler written in C++

## Features
- Lexer
- Parser
- Symbol Table

## How to Run
```bash
g++ lexer.cpp -o lexer
g++ parser.cpp -o parser
./lexer
./parser

## Backend Overview

The backend of the mini compiler is responsible for processing the output generated by the lexer and parser. 
It performs semantic analysis, manages symbol information, and executes the program logic.

The backend ensures that the program follows correct semantic rules and executes correctly.

## Backend Components

- **Symbol Table**  
  Stores variable names and their corresponding values during execution.

- **Semantic Analyzer**  
  Validates correct usage of variables and checks for logical errors.

- **Execution Engine**  
  Executes the program by evaluating expressions and statements.

## Backend Workflow

1. Tokens generated by the lexer are passed to the parser.
2. Parser builds the internal representation of the program.
3. Semantic checks are performed using the symbol table.
4. Program logic is executed step by step.
5. Output is displayed to the user.

## Note

This project focuses on understanding compiler construction concepts such as lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic processing.  
The backend is intentionally kept simple for educational purposes.
